AfterCraftZ is an ambitious Minecraft mod that immerses you in a world devastated by an apocalypse, where survival is the only goal. The map, vast and diverse, combines abandoned cities, hostile countrysides, gloomy forests, and crumbling buildings, providing a perfect playground for perilous exploration and intense confrontations.

Players must adapt to an environment where every resource counts: scavenge ruins to find food, gear, and weapons, or improvise tools to improve your chances of survival. The options are plentiful: barricade a house for temporary shelter or build a fortified base to defend against multiple threats. Danger is everywhere: hordes of roaming zombies, hostile animals like starving wolves and bears, and other survivors willing to do whatever it takes to get what they need. Add to that the constant risk posed by other players, who can either be invaluable allies or ruthless enemies.
